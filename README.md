## Key Features:

üå¶Ô∏è Real-Time Weather Data: Explore and fetch real-time weather information for any city worldwide, enabling accurate simulations based on current weather conditions.

üåÄ Wind Turbine Simulation: Simulate wind turbines' behavior and efficiency dynamically, responding to real-time wind speeds to assess their performance.

üåûüåë Day and Night Cycle: Experience the dynamic transition between day and night according to the real time data

‚òî Rainfall Simulation: Observe and analyze the impact of rainfall on renewable energy sources and urban environments

üåÜ City Infrastructure Design: Design and optimize city layouts, considering renewable energy integration, sustainability, and environmental factors.

üè≠ Real-Time Pollution Detection: Monitor and detect pollution levels in the simulated city environment, aiding in understanding environmental impact.

‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Panel Energy Estimation: Estimate solar panel energy output based on various factors like location, weather, and panel configurations.

## Future Implementation
- Reducing the bundle size to make the WebGL smoother
- Code Optimization
- User alert box to catch errors

## Exception
- The actual time of the city is given random values for the demonstration
- The rainfall depends the rainIntensity of the city which is also given the random values.
